# GOG_GDINTAI

Game of the Generals is a board game that is originated from the Philippines. In real life, the game should be played by three people: 2 opposing sides and one arbiter, but in this program, 1 person can already play in the game. We created an AI for the player's opponent. The AI relies on the response of an evaluation function. The function generates a heuristic score based on the current events on the board, it checks all the possible moves and strains the list leaving the best move/choice for the AI. The evaluation function algorithm is "minimax" that searches for the move that will be the max minimize gain for the AI.
The "AI vs AI" game mode was not finished in this project.
